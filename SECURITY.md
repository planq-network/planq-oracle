## Security Announcements

Public announcements of new releases with security fixes and of disclosure of any vulnerabilities will be made in the Planq [Security Announcements](https://t.me/PlanqNetwork) channel.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Weâ€™re extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Planq community. All reports are thoroughly investigated.

**Please do not file a public ticket** mentioning any vulnerability.

The Planq community asks that all suspected vulnerabilities be privately and responsibly disclosed.

You can also email the [security@planq.network](mailto:security@planq.network) list with the details of reproducing the vulnerability as well as the usual details expected for all bug reports.

While the primary focus of this disclosure program is the Planq protocol and the Planq wallet, the team may be able to assist in coordinating a response to a vulnerability in the third-party apps or tools in the Planq ecosystem.

You may encrypt your email to this list using this GPG key (but encryption using GPG is NOT required to make a disclosure):
